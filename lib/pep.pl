/** <module> SWISH PEP (Policy Enforcement Point)

This module implements the _Policy Enforcement   Point_. It is called by
modules that perform operations that may   not be publically accessible.
Examples are:

  - Access to files (download, create, update, delete, list, search)
  - Control of the sandboxing
  - Access to users (profile management)

%!  authorized(+Action, +Options) is det.
%
%   Verify that Action is authorized.  Options:
%
%     - indentity(+Identity)
%       Indentity is the identity dict as collected by autenticate.pl.
%
%   Actions defined:
%
%     * Gitty store actions
%       - gitty(download(Obj, Format))
%         Attempt to download Obj, one of file(File) or hash(Hash) in
%         Format, see storage_get/4 from storage.pl
%       - gitty(create(File,Named,Meta))
%         Create file name File with the given meta-data.  Named is one
%         of `named` or `random` and indicates whether the file is named
%         by the user or the name is generated by the system.
%       - gitty(update(File,PrevMeta,Meta))
%         Update File and change meta-data from PrevMeta to Meta.
%       - gitty(delete(File,Meta))
%         Delete File that has the given meta data.
%     * File actions
%       - file(update(File,Meta))
%         Update (save) a physical file outside the versioned gitty
%         store.
%     * Social options
%       - chat(open)
%         Open websocket chat channel
%       - chat(post(Message, About))
%         Post a chat message about a specific topic
%
%   @throws http_reply(forbidden(URL)) if the action is not allowed. Can
%   we generate a JSON error object?

%!  ws_authorized(+Action, +WSUser) is semidet.
%
%   True when WSUser is allowed to  perform   action.  WSUser  is a dict
%   containing the user info as  provided by chat:chat_add_user_id/3. It
%   notably has a key `profile_id` if the user is logged on.
%
%   @tbd Generalise. Notably, how do we get the identity as
%   authenticate/2 returns?

%!  deny(+Action, +Id)

%!  swish_config:approve(+Action, +Identity, -Approve) is semidet.
%
%   This hook is called by approve/2 and deny/2 before the default
