/** <module> Setup SWISH sessions

Various parts of SWISH require HTTP sessions.  At some point the session
options need to be set.  That  is   achieved  by  loading this file just
before all is finished and this   _after_ loading config files, plugins,
etc.

Currently we set global  session  options.   In  later  versions  we may
examine settings and configuration provided  by   the  modules that need
sessions.
