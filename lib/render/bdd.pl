/** <module> Render Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)

This renderer draws Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) that express
CLP(B) constraints.

Both kinds of residual goals that `library(bdd)` can emit are
supported by this renderer: By default, `library(clpb)` emits `sat/1`
residual goals. These are first translated to BDDs by reposting the
goals while temporarily setting `clpb_residuals` to `bdd`. The
translation of such BDDs to `dot/1` terms is straight-forward.
Alternatively, you can set `clpb_residuals` to `bdd` yourself. In that
case, residual goals are directly emitted as BDDs and are again
translated to `dot/1` terms by this renderer.

In both cases, the graphviz renderer is used for the final output.
