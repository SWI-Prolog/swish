/** <module> SWISH search from the navigation bar

This library supports both typeahead of the   search  box and the actual
search from the server side. What do we want to search for?

  - Predicates (built-in, library)
    - How should we handle documentation?  PlDoc?  Manual?
  - Source files (name, tags, meta-data, content?)
    - Show matching sources in modal dialog and allow switching to
      these?
