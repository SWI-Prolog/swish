/** <module> Load the SWISH server for local usage

This module loads the SWISH server for default local usage, i.e., mostly
for developing SWISH. The file `daemon.pl` can be used as a start to run
it as a server process.

This file is normally used from  `run.pl`,   which  is started like this
from   the   shell   to   start   the   SWISH   server   accessible   on
http://localhost:3050/

%    Start the web-server on Port.  Port  may   be  unbound  to make the
%    system  select  a  free  port.  Port  can   also  be  of  the  form
%    `localhost:Port`  to  bind  the  server    only  to  the  localhost
%    interface.   The   broadcast   messages     are   compatible   with
