/** <module> Provide swish/0 from any Prolog session

This module provides swish/0 and swish/1   as  auto-loaded commands from
any Prolog shell. This allows you to run   the  command below in a shell
and both enjoy swish and keep your local development environment.

    ?- swish.

## Installation

This file must be installed in your   personal library. The location can
be found using the command below

    ?- absolute_file_name(app_config(lib), Dir, [solutions(all)]).

The default on non-Windows systems   is ``~/.config/swi-prolog/lib`` and
`myswish.pl` can be installed using these commands:

    mkdir -p ~/.config/swi-prolog/lib
    cp myswish.pl ~/.config/swi-prolog/lib
    edit ~/.config/swi-prolog/lib/myswish.pl	# fix path below
    swipl
    ?- make_library_index('~/.config/swi-prolog/lib').
    ?- halt.

And test the result by starting Prolog   in a __writable directory__ and
run `?- swish.`. If all is right,  Prolog should report it started swish
and your browser should be directed to the newly created swish instance.

## Remarks

Running swish creates a directory `data`  in the current directory where
SWISH stores settings and your  programs.  You   can  copy  this  to new
locations or delete it when done.
