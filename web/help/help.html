<h2 id="help-basics">Basic operation</h2>
<p>
Prolog is about running a <i>query</i> against a <i>program</i>. The
<i>query</i> goes into the bottom-right editor and the <i>program</i>
into the left editor.  The program can be empty, executing queries
against the <i>built-in</i> predicates of Prolog.  For example:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
?- format("Hello world!~n").</pre>

<p>
A query can be executed by hitting <code>RETURN</code> if the query is
<em>complete</em> (i.e., ends in a full-stop) or by using the <a
class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Run!</a> button. At this moment, the
following happens:

<ol>
  <li>The interface creates a <em>runner</em> in the top-right window
      that controls the execution of the query.
  <li>The runner collects the text from the top-left editor (if any)
      and the query and sends this to the server, which creates a <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pengines">Pengine</a>
      (<i>Prolog Engine</i>).
  <li>The Pengine compiles the program into a temporary private module.
  <li>The Pengine assesses whether executing the query can compromise
      the server.  If this fails, an error is displated.  See
      the help topic <b>Caveats ...</b> for details.
  <li>If the query is considered safe, it executes the query and
      communicates with the <em>runner</em>
      about the results using JSON messages.  The <em>runner</em>
      interaction is described in the help topic <b>Runner ...</b>
</ol>

<p>
Note that <b>you do not have to save your program to execute it</b>. If
your are not satisfied with the answer to a query, you can simply edit
the program and use <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Run!</a> again.
The new query is executed in a completely new environment. In
particular, data that you asserted in a previous query is not available
in the next.

<p class="note">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span> Use
<strong> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter â†µ</kbd></strong> to insert a newline in a complete query

<h2 id="help-examples">Embedding examples in the program text</h2>
<p>
If you include example goals inside comments as shown below,
they will be used to populate the example menu and make the
first goal show in the Goal input field.
</p>
<pre style="font-size:80%">
/** &lt;examples&gt;

?- loves(X, mia).
?- jealous(X, Y).

*/</pre>

<h2 id="help-share">Save or share your program</h2>
<p>
The menu <b>File/Save ...</b> can be used to save your program.  There
are several options:

  <ul>
    <li>By default, the program is saved to a randomly generated name
        and may be searched by all users.  The <b>Public | Name</b> fields
	can be used to hide the file and/or give it a name.
    <li>The title is displayed in the search results and can help others
        to guess what the file is about.
    <li>You can fill in the author.  Future versions are likely to use
        login for that.
    <li>If an updated version of the file is changed, <b>Changes</b> may
        be used to summarise the changes.
    <li>Tags may be added to help people finding your code.  Type a comma
        (,) to start a new tag.
  </ul>

<p>
The <b>Info &amp; History ...</b> menu can be used to examine and use
old versions of the program.

<h2 id="help-include">Include other programs</h2>
<p>
If you know the name of a saved program (see above), you can reuse this
program using Prolog's <b>include/1</b> predicate as illustrated below.

<pre style="font-size:80%">
:- include(clever).
</pre>

<p>
You can also include a <em>specific version</em> of a program by including
its <em>hash</em>.  You can find the hash of a specific version using
<b>Info &amp; History ...</b>, selecting the desired version and opening
it using the <em>play</em> button.  This will display the hash in the
browser's address field.  Now, include this version using e.g.,

<pre style="font-size:80%">
:- include('23dacada6952ec6701da2dc9d4ebcf5c7b860380').
</pre>

<p>
You can also use the <i>Alias(Name)</i> syntax to include files from
the directories in the search path <i>Alias</i>.  By default this is
enabled for <code>example</code>, so the following directive allow you
to reuse the predicates from the <em>movies</em> example:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
:- include(example(movies)).
</pre>

<p>
Using <b>File/Collaborate ...</b>, you create a
<a target="_blank" href="https://togetherjs.com/">TogetherJS</a> session
that provides shared editing, chat and voice communication.

<h2 id="help-csv">Download query results as CSV</h2>
<p>
After running a query, the <strong>complete</strong> result set for the
query can be downloaded as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) document by
clicking the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download"></span> button
at the top-right of a <em>runner</em> window or using the
<strong>Download answers as CSV</strong> option from the <span
class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-hamburger"></span> button on
<em>notebook query cells</em>. This causes a dialogue to appear that
allows for specifying the columns, optionally the detailed result format
(if the server provides multiple result formats), whether only
<em>distinct</em> results should be returned and the maximum number of
results to return. The latter is by default set to 10&nbsp;000 to avoid
sending huge documents by accident. The field can be cleared to return
all results.

<h3>Download query results through an API</h3>
<p>
The CSV results can also be downloaded programmatically by directly
approaching the Pengine API. Example client code is <a
href="https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swish/tree/master/client"
target="_blank">available</a>.  For example, the `swish-ask.sh` client
can be used with `bash` to download the results for a query.  The call
below downloads a CSV file for the <em>sin</em> function.

<pre style="font-size:80%">
$ bash swish.ask.sh --server=http://swish.swi-prolog.org \
		    X,Y \
		    "between(0,90,X),Y is sin(X*pi/180)"
</pre>

<p>
The script can ask queries against stored Prolog scripts by specifying
the script on the commandline.  For example:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
$ bash swish.ask.sh --server=http://swish.swi-prolog.org \
		    sin_table.pl X,Y "sin_table(X,Y)"
</pre>

<p>
Prolog can exploit the Pengine API directly.  For example, the above can
be called as:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
?- [library(pengines)].
?- pengine_rpc('http://swish.swi-prolog.org',
	       sin_table(X,Y),
	       [ src_text(':- include(sin_table).'),
		 application(swish)
	       ]).
X = 0,
Y = 0.0 ;
X = 1,
Y = 0.01745240643728351 ;
X = 2
...
</pre>


<h2 id="help-preload">Preload SWISH with data</h2>
<p>
You can make <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
start with a loaded program using the URL <code><a href="http://swish.swi-prolog.org" style="color: inherit;
  text-decoration: none;">http://swish.swi-prolog.org/</a></code> and
providing the parameters below.  The URL accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests.

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>code<dd>
  Either the concrete code or a URL from which the code will be downloaded.
  If <code>code</code> is a URL and the extension is <code>.swinb</code>,
  the data is loaded into a SWISH notebook.
  </dd>
  <dt>background<dd>
  As <code>code</code>, but this part of the code will not be visible in
  the editor.
  </dd>
  <dt>examples<dd>
  As the above described examples comment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>q<dd>
  The initial query to load into the query window.  Note that the following
  characters need to be escaped: '#', '&' and the space.
  </dd>
  </dl>

<p>The URL below opens <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> on a file from GitHub with a default query.
