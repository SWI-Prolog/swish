  <title>Chat with SWISH users</title>

  <body>

<div class="dropup">
<p>
The <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> chat services allows you to chat with
other <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> users.  Each file acts as a chat room,
while the <b>Hangout</b> room allows you to attract attention to the
file you are working on.  The <b>bell</b> at the top-right shows the
status of the hangout room and any message sent to the hangout room
appears briefly below the bell.  The associated <i>dropdown menu</i>
provides access to both the hangout room and the room associated with
the currently active file.

<p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span
style="color:maroon">SH</span> displays an <b>avatar</b> for each user
with whom you share an open file to make you aware of other users.
Operations such as opening, reloading or closing a file are briefly
indicated to people with whom you share an open file. The <i>avatar</i>
is taken from your identity provider or <a
href="https://en.gravatar.com">gravatar.com</a> if you are logged in.
Otherwise it is a randomly generated avatar that is stored in your
browser's local store.

<p>
A chat message may include one or more <b>payload</b> objects that are
made visible as buttons. Most payloads are added using the <a class="btn
btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a> button menu. Defined
payloads are: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>selection</b>.  If you have made a selection on the
        page, this is sent along with the chat message.  Clicking
        on the <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span
	class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span></a> button restores
	this selection.  Note that you can make <b>multiple selections</b>
	using <b>Control-click</b> in the CodeMirror editor.
    <li>Your current <b>query</b> can be included using the <a class="btn
        btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a>.
    <li>System generated <b>update messages</b> include a payload that
        allows you to open the file in <b>before/after</b> mode as well
	as examine the <b>differences</b>
  </ul>

<p>
Finally, the <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a>
button may be used to create a link from the <b>shared chatroom</b> to this
file to <b>ask for support</b>.
</p>


<h3 id="chat-help">The hangout room</h3>

<p class="dropup"> The notebook <a
href="/p/Hangout.swinb">Hangout.swinb</a> provides a place to find
buddies. Messages may be cross-posted to this shared space using
<b>Broadcast to hangout</b> from the <a class="btn btn-xs
btn-primary">Send <b class="caret"></b></a> button. The message that
appears in the hangout room contains a link to the file from which it was
created.
<p>

<h3 id="chat-markdown">Markdown in chat messages</h3>

<p>
Chat messages are subject to a limited form of Markdown processing.
Currently, the patterns below replaced.  Note that these are simplified
forms of the actual regular expressions which use stronger boundary
conditions.
</p>

<table class="table table-condensed" style="width:80%; margin:auto">
<tr><th>Pattern<th>Example<th>Meaning
<tr><td>\b\w+.pl<td>program.pl<td>Link to Prolog program
<tr><td>\b\w+.swinb<td>notebook.swinb<td>Link to SWISH notebook
<tr><td>\w+/\d<td>between/3<td>Link to documentation on predicate
<tr><td>`[^`]+`<td>`A is 1+1`<td><code>A is 1+1</code>
<tr><td>*[^*]+*<td>*never*<td><b>never</b>
<tr><td>__[^_]+__<td>__always__<td><b>always</b>
<tr><td>_[^_]+_<td>_italic_<td><i>italic</i>
</table>


<h3 id="chat-status">Status of the SWISH sharing service</h3>

<p>
What you are seeing are the first steps to allow users of SWISH to communicate.
There are many facilities we have in mind, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect editors for collaborative editing
  <li>Make <i>teams</i> that connect people also if they are not editing
      the same file.
  <li>Allow Prolog programs to exchange messages through the chat room.
</ul>
