<p>
SWISH cannot provide unrestricted access to Prolog because Prolog gives
unrestricted access to the operating system.  Therefore, SWISH examines
each goal on safety before execution.  This process unfolds the call-tree
and verifies all called predicates against a whitelist.  It fails on three
occasions:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If insufficient information is available to decide what
        will be called.  E.g., <code>?- read(X), call(X).</code>
	Such errors are raised as <em>instantiation errors</em>.
    <li>If a predicate is found that is not whitelisted.  Such
        errors are raised as <em>permission errors</em>
    <li>If a called predicate is not defined.  Such errors are
        raised as <em>existence errors</em>
  </ul>

<p>
If any of the above happens, the error is printed, along with
a chain of intermediate goals that should help finding the culprit.
Note that the whitelist is incomplete, i.e., there are many
predicates that can be considered safe that are not on the list.
Please report such omissions as bugs.
</p>

<p>
Normal read and write do not work in the web environment.  A number
of normal Prolog predicates are redefined to provide basic I/O.  Other
I/O predicate are either not whitelisted or send their output to the
server's console.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>read/1
    <li>write/1, writeq/1, print/1, write_canonical/1, write_term/2,
        portray_clause/1
    <li>format/1, format/2
    <li>message_hook/3, redirecting all system messages.
  </ul>
