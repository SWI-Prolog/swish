                    <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> is inspired by web-based tools such as <a target="_blank" href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFIDDLE</a> in that it allows you to develop a program and then share it with others on the Web. However, lacking both debugger and profiler, <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> is far from a full-fledged IDE for Prolog, and to avoid compromising the server it does not allow you to execute "dangerous" predicates such as predicates reading and writing files.  It does however allow you to use predicates such as <code>read/1</code> and <code>write/1</code> but they will only read from and write to your web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
We intend to make <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
useful in an educational setting.  For example, if you are a teacher, you may want to tell
your students to share with you the solutions to exercises by sending you a link to
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> loaded
with their solutions ready to run.  There is still work to do before this is a good
alternative to a local installation though.

                <h4 id="time_limit">Time limit</h4>
                <p>
                    When you click the First button, your goal will be allowed to execute on the server for 300 seconds before aborting and returning with a message stating that the time limit has been exceeded.
                </p>
                <h4 id="browsers">Supported browsers</h4>
                <p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> works fine
recent versions of in Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer (tested IE 11).

                <h4 id="swishapp">Adding SWISH to your application</h4>
		<p>
<span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> can be added easily to any
SWI-Prolog web application.  For example, it is available as an extension pack for
<a target="_blank" href="http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/">ClioPatria</a>, the SWI-Prolog RDF
framework.  It can be added to ClioPatria using the command below, providing an alternative
for SPARQL for exploring the database (requires SWI-Prolog 7.1.23 or later).

                    <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
is implemented as a set of <a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugins,
using <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for menus, modal windows
and various styling aspects and <a target="_blank" href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>
for editing the Prolog source and query.  Queries are executed by sending both the source text
(left editor) and query (bottom-right editor) to the server, which creates a <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pengines">Pengine</a> (<i>Prolog Engine</i>)
to execute the query.
		</p>
		<p>
Pengines have many other applications, such as supporting Prolog RPC (<i>Remote Procedure
Calls</i>, which allows you to execute a query fully transparent, including backtracking,
on a remote server.  An interesting aspect is that they provide a generic query language
on top of an arbitrary Prolog program that can be used from JavaScript.  A
<a target="_blank" href="http://pengines.swi-prolog.org/">demo is available</a>
                </p>
